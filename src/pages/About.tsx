I did the Golden LEGOÂ®Store as a Front End application using Vite/React and Typescript. I had always been interested in exploring Bootstrap Components, so I decided to give it a try. I hope you enjoyed the store and added items to your cart! My information is linked below so we can connect and collaborate :)
