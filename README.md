# Welcome to the Golden Lego Store!

## I created this online store front end application to show my skills using Typescript and React/Vite.

## The styling was done using CSS, Bootstrap, Canvas, React Icons, and Google Fonts.

The functionality of this application includes using the React-router-dom to transfer between pages,
addind and removing items from the shopping cart, and seeing each item's information when opening a Modal.


# Getting Started

To install the required dependencies run `npm install`.

Run `npm run dev` to see the application locally.
